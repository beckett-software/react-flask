# ðŸ’« Beckett Framework

_The Framework for Building strictly-typed Python and React TypeScript Websites_

![Beckett maze](docs/banner.jpg)

Welcome to Beckett, a strictly-typed Flask and React TypeScript application template.

Beckett combines a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) server, with a robust [React TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) UI, providing a comprehensive full stack framework.

Beckett features a sophisticated types manager that automatically synchronizes [Python Type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and [TypeScript interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html). This means that as you make changes to your code, Beckett diligently keeps the API interface in perfect harmony.

While Beckett is strongly opinionated, favoring specific design choices, it significantly enhances productivity by providing a cohesive development experience and reducing the time spent on manual synchronization.

## Built on popular tools

Both TypeScript and Python hold their positions as two of the [most widely used programming languages globally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/). As a result, they are frequently combined in various projects.

However, setting up a smooth and efficient development environment that harmoniously integrates these languages can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process, often leading to a subpar developer experience. Thankfully, Beckett steps in to solve this challenge by tightly coupling TypeScript and Python into one cohesive framework.

## Currently in development

Before this becomes a fully fledged package, it exists as a decent template that can be forked when you start a new project and worked on from there.

## Set up

Fork the code, then run the build and dev command to get started:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:beckett-software/beckett-framework.git
cd beckett-framework
make build
make dev
```
